# NVCRepository

NVC is a comercial project, which was developed when I was on OOP cources (please don't criticize much =) )
Client is small company (Collector) which provides services for telecommunication companies and financial companies.

This program was created for searching and listening the records of telephone conversations. Also there is an opportunity to save the records, in automatically created folder, on desktop.
