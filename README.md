# NVCRepository

NVC is a comercial project, which was developed when I was on OOP cources (please don't criticize much =) )
The client was a company (Collector), which provides services for different types of business.

This program was created for searching and listening the records of telephone conversations (Project managers were using it, to listen conversations of specialists of contact center). Also there is an opportunity to save the records, in automatically created folder, on desktop.
